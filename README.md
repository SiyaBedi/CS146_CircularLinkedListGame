# CS146_CircularLinkedListGame

There are n number of prisoners. We start from the first prisoner and count down k prisoners down the line. The prison we 
land on each time will be eliminated until only one prisoner remains. Each time we reach the end of the line, we start from the 
first prisoner again and this is why we use a circular linked list.
